## TODO:
- Add description
- Add detailed instructions for how to build the project locally
    - Add platform specific details. For instance, requiring `dpkg`, `fakeroot`, `rpmdevtools`, and `rpmlint` for deb.


## Build
The following command should package the application into `/out`:
```bash
npm run make
```
